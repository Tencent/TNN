  FlatBuffers compiler

  NOTE: This snap also ships the necessary header files required to compile
  projects using flatbuffers, however, for the compilation to work, you have
  to manually add the following path in your project's configuration:

  /snap/flatbuffers/current/include

  If you need to use flatbuffers headers from a location other than the above
  path, it is recommended to not use this snap as that could cause a mismatch.
