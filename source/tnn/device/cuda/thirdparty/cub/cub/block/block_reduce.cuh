//!
//! Overview
//! +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
//!
//! - A `reduction <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduce_(higher-order_function)>`_ (or *fold*) uses a binary combining
//!   operator to compute a single aggregate from a list of input elements.
//! - @rowmajor

//!   #. :cpp:enumerator:`cub::BLOCK_REDUCE_RAKING_COMMUTATIVE_ONLY`:
//!      An efficient "raking" reduction algorithm that only supports commutative reduction operators.
//!   #. :cpp:enumerator:`cub::BLOCK_REDUCE_RAKING`:
//!      An efficient "raking" reduction algorithm that supports commutative and non-commutative reduction operators.

//!      A quick "tiled warp-reductions" reduction algorithm that supports commutative and non-commutative
//!      reduction operators.
//!
//! Performance Considerations
//! +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
//!
//! - @granularity
//! - Very efficient (only one synchronization barrier).
//! - Incurs zero bank conflicts for most types
//! - Computation is slightly more efficient (i.e., having lower instruction overhead) for:
//!   - Summation (vs. generic reduction)
//!   - ``BLOCK_THREADS`` is a multiple of the architecture's warp size
//!   - Every thread has a valid input (i.e., full vs. partial-tiles)
//! - See cub::BlockReduceAlgorithm for performance details regarding algorithmic alternatives
//!
//! A Simple Example
